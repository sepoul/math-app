"""Build a CrewAI Agent for one persona of the math_conversation panel.

Loads the persona spec from the prompt registry
([mathai.math_conversation.registry.load_persona]) and its declared
skills, concatenates skill bodies onto the backstory, and returns a
configured `crewai.Agent`. Tools are wired from the union of the
persona's skills' `tool_allowlist`, filtered against the names the
caller actually provides in `tools_by_name` — unknown names (e.g. a
skill that references a not-yet-wired tool) are silently dropped, which
keeps skill authoring decoupled from tool availability.

`crewai` is imported lazily so this module is safe to import from any
runtime (the API, the default worker, tests). Only the crewai-runtime
worker triggers the import by calling `build_agent`.

    `tools_by_name` maps tool name (as referenced in a skill's

    receives only the subset of tools whose names appear in any of its
    skills' allowlists. `conclude` is always implicitly allowed — every
    panelist may end the conversation — and is wired whenever it appears

    `model` overrides the persona's front-matter `model:` field; both
    fall back to `CREW_MODEL` env / `DEFAULT_MODEL`. Per-persona model
    selection is the design's intended hook for putting (say) a stronger
    model on the Synthesist than on a quicker speaker.
