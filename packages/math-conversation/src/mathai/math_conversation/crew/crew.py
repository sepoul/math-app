"""Multi-persona panel builder for math_conversation.

Replaces the single-agent micro builder (see `crew_builder.py`). A
panel is *not* one CrewAI Crew with N sequential tasks: that shape
can't early-exit when a panelist calls `conclude`. Instead,
`RunCrewStep` owns a Python loop and constructs one single-agent /
single-task Crew per turn; this module supplies the prebuilt panel
(agents + signals + display metadata) and the per-turn `Crew` factory.

Transcript handling: each turn's task description embeds the running
transcript so the agent has full context. The transcript is a simple
`[Role]\\ncontent` block per turn — round-trippable, human-readable,
and what the model already sees in chat-completion form.

Turn ordering is round-robin in v1; a single conductor / picker prompt
is a follow-up the design doc names explicitly. The personae order is
fixed in `DEFAULT_PANEL` and can be overridden via `build_panel(...)`.

CrewAI is imported lazily — only `build_turn_crew` triggers the import,
keeping the rest of the module safe to import from any runtime.
